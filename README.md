# Cardiovascular-Risk-Classification

## Project Type
EDA + Classification

## Project Summary

This project focuses on predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using patient-level clinical and behavioral data. Early prediction can lead to better preventive care and health outcomes. By analyzing a dataset containing various health metrics such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and diabetes history, we aim to build a classification model that can accurately assess a person's risk of developing CHD over the next decade.
